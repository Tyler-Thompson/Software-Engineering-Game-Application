MENU SYSTEMS

2. I want a windowed and a full-screen option in the options screen.
3. I want there to be an accessible mute/unmute option in the options screen.

5. I want to be able to pause the game and access a menu where I can resume, exit, save progress, or go to options at any time by pressing a key. (ESC by default)

BASIC GAME ENGINE SYSTEMS

8. I want my character to have a health bar and a power bar which are displayed in a GUI to the user while in-game.
9. I want enemies to wander when they are a significant distance from the player, and move toward the player if they come within a given radius of aggression.
19. I want the player to be forced into a battle if they are approached by an enemy.
10. I want a turn-based battle system where the player is given a choice of action and an unlimited amount of time to make their choice, then the enemy is given a choice of action, and the process repeats until one side is victorious.
11. I want to have items that are easily viewable/usable in-game.
12. I want time in-game to be integrated with real-life time (based on laptop/cell phone clock) that will change what the game looks like when it is night vs when it is day.
13. I want there to be an in-game shop where you can spend in-game currency.
